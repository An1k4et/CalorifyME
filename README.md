# How Calorifyme is usefull?

Calorifyme are tools that allow you to track the number of calories you consume in your food and beverages. These apps often have databases of various foods and drinks with their corresponding calorie counts, making it easier for you to log and track your intake

Overall, Calorifyme can be a helpful tool for those looking to manage their weight and improve their overall health and nutrition. However, it's important to keep in mind that the quality of the calories you consume is just as important as the quantity, so it's important to prioritize nutrient-dense foods as well.

This Calorie Calculator is based on several equations, and the results of the calculator are based on an estimated average. The Harris-Benedict Equation was one of the earliest equations used to calculate basal metabolic rate (BMR), which is the amount of energy expended per day at rest. It was revised in 1984 to be more accurate and was used up until 1990, when the Mifflin-St Jeor Equation was introduced. The Mifflin-St Jeor Equation also calculates BMR, and has been shown to be more accurate than the revised Harris-Benedict Equation.


Mifflin-St Jeor Equation:


BMR = 10W + 6.25H - 5A + 5

where:

W is body weight in kg

H is body height in cm

A is age
